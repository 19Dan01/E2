This library was adapted from the code provided by E+E Electronics (www.epluse.com).
It provides several functions, such as temperature, humidity and CO2 readings, sensor state reading, and custom memory reading.

You are strongly advised to read the E2 protocol description available on the E+E website.

The development of the functions needed to read the memory from a custom address, and to write to a custom address is currently under way.
